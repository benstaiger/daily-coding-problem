# 
# Boggle is a game played on a 4 x 4 grid of letters. The goal is to find as
# many words as possible that can be formed by a sequence of adjacent letters
# in the grid, using each cell at most once. Given a game board and a
# dictionary of valid words, implement a Boggle solver.


def boggle(grid, dictionary):
    # starting at each position, do a DFS where we traverse the boggle grid
    # as well as a Trie formed from all words in our dictionary.

    # honestly...that's a lot to implement in a 30-45 minute coding problem.
    # Googling, it seems like I am right that this is the best solution.
    pass
